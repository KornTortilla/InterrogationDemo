      on their own.

      Ace: If any of the information they say seems to be false,
      perhaps due to the evidence pointing to contrary, that is the moment to present
      your findings.

      Ace: Here, I''ll give you opportunity to do so.

      you can only save one of the suspect''s statements as a time.

      Ace: Moving
      on, there''s one last piece of information to share. We can keep track of all
      the statements from suspects and store them, allowing you to easily go back
      to them.

      Ace: At times, the suspect will speak against themselves, giving
      you a prime opportunity to use their own words against them instead.

      Ace:
      It''s important to record their words as evidence for this purpose, which you
      can do below here[tutorial save]. [anim Ace Smile]You''ll want to do that when
      the suspect is done speaking, however.

      Ace: I''ll
      give you another opportunity to try it out here. I''ll first incorrectly say
