  <Text>k__BackingField: The theft was suspected to happen after 3:30 PM, as the
    last worker had clocked out at that point. The theft was reported at 7:15 PM,
    after the owner noticed the missing money. The suspect was apprehended around
    9 PM after an anoymous call reporting he was talking about something about a
    theft from the suspect.
