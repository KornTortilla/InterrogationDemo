  <Text>k__BackingField: The theft was suspected to happen after 3:30 PM, as the
    last worker had clocked out at that point. The theft was reported at 7:15 PM,
    after the owner noticed the missing money. The suspect was apprehended around
    9 PM at a bar after an anoymous call reporting he was talking about suspicious
    behavior from the suspect. There is no sign of money being stored in the suspect's
    bank account.
