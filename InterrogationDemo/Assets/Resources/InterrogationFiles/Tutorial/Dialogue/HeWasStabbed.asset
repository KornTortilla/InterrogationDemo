    Ace:
    At times, the suspect will speak against themselves, giving you a prime opportunity
    to use their own words against them instead.

    Ace: It''s important to record
    their words as evidence for this purpose, which you can do below here[tutorial

    however.

    Ace: I''ll give you another opportunity to
    try it out here. I''ll first incorrectly say what my favorite color is. Then,
    ask me what it actually is and record it. Finally, come back here and present
    that.

    Ace: Here goes then: My favorite color is blue.'
