  <Name>k__BackingField: Pointing Out Contradictions
  <Speakers>k__BackingField: []
  <Text>k__BackingField: 'That''s perfectly fine! We''ll start with what you''ll
    be doing. The game is centered around pointing out contradictions, strictly false
    statements. You''ll reference your evidence or gather the suspect''s statements
    to point out falsehoods.

    You can look at your evidence in the Evidence Locker
    with the button to the far left. I recommend reading through the evidence you
    start with once ingame to know what''s going on.

    As you go through different
    questions and find untrue statements, you can drag the evidence that contradicts
    on the area above the textbox.

    Try pointing out the following statement
    as untrue with the correct evidence- "Steven was at the party at 5PM."'
